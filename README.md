# YoutubeDownloader

## This project is a WIP! While it currently can download videos, there is no format customization, and the file serving system is lacking, to say the least.

A very simple browser based youtube video downloader. Frontend written in Vue and backend written in ExpressJS. Videos are downloaded via [youtube-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

Latest prerelease can be found [here](https://github.com/TheBozzz34/YoutubeDownloader/releases/tag/1.0)
